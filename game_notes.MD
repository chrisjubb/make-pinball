by the flippers there is a bank of lights in a fan formation. the active light flashes white (starts at the bottom).
the pop bumpers form another bank - each hit lights up a light on the 'snake' which is completed when all the lights are completed.

hitting the target banks lights up the active light with the bank colour. then the active light moves on.
these continue to flash until they are banked by hitting the top scoop.
if the ball drains the flashing shots are lost - if you get multiple ones banked you get the score multiplied.
the harder the target bank the more points you get.

at the end of the ball, any connected lines that are coloured the same receive bonuses.
the longer the connection the more points too.

if the ball enters the left hand side of the playfield, all the other lights go off and the tilt is less sensitive - the point is to nudge the game to hit all the lights - then nudge it out so that it doesn't drain on the left outlane. this target bank is rewarded the most - because it's difficult to get to too.

bank list (easiest to hardest):
right hand side (4 of them)
mid left hand side (7 of them) - should be hit pretty often
pop bumpers - should be filled up quite easily
top lanes - hard to get to after plunge - but might get them from pop bumpers
far left lane - risk of draining


hitting the targets increases the score anyway. so does hitting the slingshots.
